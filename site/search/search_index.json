By: Josh Kaufman <p> Rapid skill acquisition has nothing in common with how you \u2018learned how to learn\u2019 in school. Academic learning and credentialing have almost zero overlap with skill acquisition, let alone achieving it quickly for exmmple: someone who studies Spanish in class vs someone who lives in south America and picks up the language. </p> <p>There is also a difference between  skill acquisition and training. Training means improiving a skill you\u2019ve already acquired through repetition. It is what happens after you\u2019ve acquired a basic skill if you want to keep on improving. Ex; running as a child vs preparing for a marathon is very different.</p> <p>Most modern methods of education and credentialing require simple compliance. The primary goal isn\u2019t to acquire a skill, but to complete an arbitrary set of criteria. </p> <p>Rigorous education can actually prevent skill acquisition. The primary problem is opportunity cost: if the requirement to obtain the credential are so intense they can impair your ability to spend time practicing the skill in question. Ex: a omputer science undergrad will spend 4 years memorizing algorithms but not be working towards his goal of starting his own computer program.</p> <p>In his first book The personal MBA: Master the art of business (2010) he explains he skipped grad school and instead worked on creating his own business. \u201cif you want to get good at anything where real-life performance matters, you have to actually practice the skill in context. Study, by itself, is never enough.\u201d</p> <p> This book adheres to the \u2018three-stage-model\u2019:  1.Cognitive (early) stage- understanding what you are trying to do, researching, thinking about the process, and breaking the skill into manageable parts  2.Associative (intermediate) stage-  Practicing the task, noticing environmental feedback, and adjusting your approach based on the feedback.  3.Autonomous (late) stage-  Performing the skill effectively and efficiently without thinking about it or paying unnecessary attention to the process.   <p>Ten Principles of Rapid Skill Acquisition:  1.  Choose a loveable project (\u201cThe best thing that can happen to a human being is to find a problem, fall in love with the problem, and live trying to solve that problem\u201d)  2.  Focus your energy on one skill at a time 3.  Define your target performance level (create a brief statement of what your desired level of skill would look like. As a rule, the more relaxed your target performance level, the more rapidly you can acquire a skill) 4.  Deconstruct the skill into sub-skills (everything we think of as skills are actually a bundle of smaller subskills) master to critical subskills first.  5.  Obtain critical tools 6.  Eliminate barriers to practice 7.  Make dedicated time for practice (You have 24 hours to invest in each day; 1,440 minutes, no more no less. If you sleep approximately 8 hours, you have 16 hours at your disposal with another large chunk used to take care of yourself and others. Take time for at least 90 minutes of practice each day by cutting out low value- activities as much as possible. Pre-commit to put in 20 hours of practice. The reason for this is that the early parts of skill acquisition process usually feels harder than it actually is. You will run into problems and barriers. Think of this initial hump an exercise of \u2018grit\u2019. 8.  Create fast feedback loops Fast feedback leads to rapid skill acquisition. This is why trainers are helpful by constantly telling you ways in which you are improving. You don\u2019t need a coach if you record yourself, on video, journaling, training aides, etc.. 9.  Practice by the clock in short bursts Our minds are built to learn- to notice patterns, stimulate potential courses of action, and figure out what\u2019s probably going to happen next. They\u2019re not built to accurately estimate time- how long something will take, or how much time you\u2019ve spent doing something\u2026. Set aside time for three to five practice sessions a day. 10. Emphasize quantity and speed  Do not aim for quality. Instead aim for deliberate and consistent practicing as much as you can while maintaining at least \u2018good enough\u2019 form. </p> <p> This does not mean that \u2018Learning\u2019 is Not important! Remember, that learning is not the same as skill acquisition but doing a bit of research (internally and externally) can save you precious time. Here are the Eight principles of effective learning: 1.  Research the skill and related topics Spend twenty minutes searching the web, browsing a bookstore, or scanning for others who hone the skill. Identity maybe 3 resources or so. The objective is to identitfy the most important subskills, critical components, and required tools for practice as quickly as possible. 2.  Jump in over your head Some of your resources will contain concepts, techniques, and ideas you don\u2019t understand. Often, something will appear particularly important but you have no idea what it means. Your initial confusion is normal. Move towards the confusion.  3.  Identify mental models and mental hooks Create your own mental models and examples to grasp what things means. This may often include learning the lingo associated with a field. Ex:  what \u2018server\u2019 means in programming 4.  Imagine the opposite of what you want Envision what could possibly go wrong? It certainly could not be so bad. If you escape the worst possible scenario then you are already doing pretty well. 5.  Talk to practitioners to set expectations Talking to people who have acquired the skill before you will help you dispel myths and misconeptions before you invest your time and energy.  6.  Eliminate distractions in your environment 7.  Use spaced repetition  According to Tony Schwartz (the power of full engagement) and (be excellent at anything) the optimal learning cycle appears to be approximately ninety minutes of focused concentration. Anymore, and your mind and body will need a break. Use that time to eat, sleep, exercise, do other chores. </p>"},{"location":"projects/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This is the introduction to your notes.</p> Notes Projects About Note 1 Note 2 Note 3 Project 1 Project 2 Project 3 About Us"}]}
